# Term 4 Digital Technology Game

Files:
 - gamev3.py (is anotated but very long)
 - tilemaps.py (the library reading the tilemaps I built. Not anotated, but here easy to understand)
 - map.py (an example map that is bundled with the game. Not anotated, and only for data purposes)

## Actual file tree

The actual file tree is quite different from this:

/-
 |- gamev3.py (main game)
 |- server.py (multiplayer aspect that didn't work)
 |- server.exe (the executable for server.py)
 |- data.json (holds data)
 |- maps/
      |- tilemaps.py (handles tilemaps)
      |- default/
            |- map.py (the map data)
            |- *.png (the textures for the tiles)

## To run the game:

Go to <https://github.com/NotLawson/Digital-Technology-class/releases/> and follow instructions.
There might be a Windows SmartScreen Alert. This is because Windows doesn't recognise the creator (me) as a valid creator.
